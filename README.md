# Maze
Here, we want to solve a maze with two graph search algorithms, Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A*. 
The maze structure, start, and goal location are given to the program. Then the program finds the path from start to finish with its cost.
The passable and the blocked cells in the maze are shown as ' ' and 'X' respectively.
